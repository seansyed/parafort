## 🚨 Critical Security Reminders

### ⚠️ Never Do This in Production:
- [ ] Use test/development API keys
- [ ] Expose sensitive environment variables
- [ ] Use weak passwords or default credentials
- [ ] Leave debug mode enabled
- [ ] Skip SSL certificate validation
- [ ] Use HTTP instead of HTTPS
- [ ] Expose database directly to internet
- [ ] Use root user for application

### ✅ Always Do This:
- [ ] Use environment variables for secrets
- [ ] Enable HTTPS everywhere
- [ ] Validate all user inputs
- [ ] Log security events
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Use principle of least privilege
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious activity

## 📞 Emergency Procedures

### 🚨 If Application Goes Down:
1. Check health endpoint: `curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health`
2. Check Docker containers: `docker-compose ps`
3. Check logs: `docker-compose logs -f app`
4. Restart if needed: `docker-compose restart`
5. Check system resources: `htop`, `df -h`

### 🔒 If Security Breach Suspected:
1. Immediately change all passwords and API keys
2. Review access logs
3. Check for unauthorized changes
4. Notify users if data compromised
5. Document incident for analysis

### 💾 If Database Issues:
1. Check database connectivity
